### About

In the regulatory assessment of chemicals (e.g. under [REACH](http://tinyurl.com/eureach),Quantitative Structure Activity Models (QSAR) are playing an increasingly important role in predicting properties for hazard and risk assessment. This implies both a need to be able to identify relevant QSARs and to use them to derive estimates and/or have access to their precalculated estimates. To help meet these needs, the JRC QSAR Model Database is established and freely accessible through [http://qsardb.jrc.it](http://qsardb.jrc.it) . 

The QSAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) is a harmonised template for summarising and reporting key information on QSAR models, including the results of any validation studies. The information is structured according to the OECD validation principles.

Download the [QMRF Editor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qmrf/files/QMRF%20Editor/) in order to describe your models in QMRF format and send the descriptions to JRC-IHCP-COMPUTOX@ec.europa.eu  to have them included in the database. 

The QMRF schema 3.0 is updated Oct 2016 to include ontology annotation and enhancements applicable for reporting models, using nanomaterials.
